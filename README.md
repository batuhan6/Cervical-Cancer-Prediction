## Cervical Cancer-Prediction Using XG-boost algorithm

Cervical Cancer kills about 4000 women in the US and 300000 women in the worldwide annually. By leveraging machine learning and ai cervical cancer death rate can be dramatically reduced with early detection and diagnosis.

In this project I used extreme gradient boosting algorithm(XG-boost algorithm). This algorithm can be used for regression and classification tasks. This algorithm offers solid robustness and i
